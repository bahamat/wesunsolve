## What is this?

This repository holds down the code that has been used from the begining on http://wesunsolve.net website.
The RIP page lies there: https://espix.net/~wildcat//wss/

## ???

This website has been turned down by Oracle and as it's been requested by a lot of people, I thought it was now time to actually publish the source code of all this. 
It is provided as-is and is intended for educational purpose only. 
I'm declining any responsability or trouble you may get into by using even part of all this.
