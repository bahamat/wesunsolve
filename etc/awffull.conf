# HTMLPre defines HTML code to insert at the very beginning of the
# file.  Default is the DOCTYPE line shown below.  Max line length
# is 80 characters, so use multiple HTMLPre lines if you need more.

#HTMLPre <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">

# HTMLHead defines HTML code to insert within the <HEAD></HEAD>
# block, immediately after the <TITLE> line.  Maximum line length
# is 80 characters, so use multiple lines if needed.

#HTMLHead <META NAME="author" CONTENT="AWFFull">

# HTMLBody defined the HTML code to be inserted, starting with the
# <BODY> tag.  If not specified, the default is shown below.  If
# used, you MUST include your own <BODY> tag as the first line.
# Maximum line length is 80 char, use multiple lines if needed.

#HTMLBody <BODY BGCOLOR="#E8E8E8" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#FF0000">

# HTMLPost defines the HTML code to insert immediately before the
# first <HR> on the document, which is just after the title and
# "summary period"-"Generated on:" lines.  If anything, this should
# be used to clean up in case an image was inserted with HTMLBody.
# As with HTMLHead, you can define as many of these as you want and
# they will be inserted in the output stream in order of appearance.
# Max string size is 80 characters.  Use multiple lines if you need to.

#HTMLPost       <BR CLEAR="all">

# HTMLTail defines the HTML code to insert at the bottom of each
# HTML document, usually to include a link back to your home
# page or insert a small graphic.  It is inserted as a table
# data element (ie: <TD> your code here </TD>) and is right
# aligned with the page.  Max string size is 80 characters.

#HTMLTail <IMG SRC="yourlogo.png" ALT="Company XYZ!">

# HTMLEnd defines the HTML code to add at the very end of the
# generated files.  It defaults to what is shown below.  If
# used, you MUST specify the </BODY> and </HTML> closing tags
# as the last lines.  Max string length is 80 characters.

#HTMLEnd </BODY></HTML>

# TimeMe allows you to force the display of timing information
# at the end of processing.  A value of 'yes' will force the
# timing information to be displayed.  A value of 'no' has no
# effect.

#TimeMe         no

# GMTTime allows reports to show GMT (UTC) time instead of local
# time.  Default is to display the time the report was generated
# in the timezone of the local machine, such as EDT or PST.  This
# keyword allows you to have times displayed in UTC instead.  Use
# only if you really have a good reason, since it will probably
# screw up the reporting periods by however many hours your local
# time zone is off of GMT.

#GMTTime        no

# FoldSeqErr forces AWFFull to ignore sequence errors.
# This is useful for Netscape and other web servers that cache
# the writing of log records and do not guarantee that they
# will be in chronological order.  The use of the FoldSeqErr
# option will cause out of sequence log records to be treated
# as if they had the same time stamp as the last valid record.
# Default is to ignore out of sequence log records.

#FoldSeqErr     no

# VisitTimeout allows you to set the default timeout for a visit
# (sometimes called a 'session').  The default is 30 minutes,
# which should be fine for most sites.
# Visits are determined by looking at the time of the current
# request, and the time of the last request from the site.  If
# the time difference is greater than the VisitTimeout value, it
# is considered a new visit, and visit totals are incremented.
# Value is the number of seconds to timeout (default=1800=30min)

#VisitTimeout   1800

# IgnoreHist shouldn't be used in a config file, but it is here
# just because it might be useful in certain situations.  If the
# history file is ignored, the main "index.html" file will only
# report on the current log files contents.  Useful only when you
# want to reproduce the reports from scratch.  USE WITH CAUTION!
# Valid values are "yes" or "no".  Default is "no".

#IgnoreHist     no

# TrackPartialRequests is used to track 206 codes. This gives two
# additional columns in the Top URLs tables.
# The first to "Hits" counts the number of partial requests
# The second to "Volume" counts the volume in partial requests
# This option is more of use to those with lots of PDF's.

#TrackPartialRequests    no

# CountryGraph allows the usage by country graph to be disabled.
# Values can be 'yes' or 'no', default is 'yes'.

CountryGraph   yes

# GeoIP enables or disables the use of the GeoIP capability for more
# accurate detection of countries. Default is 'no'.
# NOTE! Do not enable GeoIP if you analyse files that have had the IP Address
# translated to a Fully Qualified Host Name.
# Use either raw IP Addresses and GeoIP, or Names and disable GeoIP.
# ie. Don't use GeoIP AND DNShistory.

GeoIP          yes

# GeoIPDatabase is the location of the GeoIP database file. Default is
# '/usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat', which is where a default GeoIP
# install will put it. Note that the database is updated monthly.
# For the details see: http://www.maxmind.com/app/geoip_country

GeoIPDatabase   /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat
#/usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat

# FlagsLocation will enable the display of country flags in the country
# table. The path is that for a webserver, not file system. Can be
# relative or complete. The trailing slash is not necessary.

#FlagsLocation		flags

# DailyGraph and DailyStats allows the daily statistics graph
# and statistics table to be disabled (not displayed).  Values
# may be "yes" or "no". Default is "yes".

#DailyGraph     yes
#DailyStats     yes

# GraphLegend allows the color coded legends to be turned on or off
# in the graphs.  The default is for them to be displayed.  This only
# toggles the color coded legends, the other legends are not changed.
# If you think they are hideous and ugly, say 'no' here :)

#GraphLegend    yes

# GraphLines allows you to have index lines drawn behind the graphs.
# Anything other than "no" will enable the lines.

#GraphLines     yes

# YearlySubtotals will display the subtotal for a given year in the main
# page. This is in addition to the Grand Total of all years.

#YearlySubtotals         no

# The "Top" options below define the number of entries for each table.
# Defaults are Sites=30, URL's=30, Referrers=30 and Agents=15, and
# Countries=30. TopKSites and TopKURLs (by KByte tables) both default
# to 10, as do the top entry/exit tables (TopEntry/TopExit).  The top
# search strings and user names default to 20.  Tables may be disabled
# by using zero (0) for the value.
# Top404Errors, displays a table of error requests, and the corresponding
# referring URL.

# The All* keywords allow the display of all URL's, Sites, Referrers
# User Agents, Search Strings and User names.  If enabled, a separate
# HTML page will be created, and a link will be added to the bottom
# of the appropriate "Top" table.  There are a couple of conditions
# for this to occur..  First, there must be more items than will fit
# in the "Top" table (otherwise it would just be duplicating what is
# already displayed).  Second, the listing will only show those items
# that are normally visible, which means it will not show any hidden
# items.  Grouped entries will be listed first, followed by individual
# items.  The value for these keywords can be either 'yes' or 'no',
# with the default being 'no'.  Please be aware that these pages can
# be quite large in size, particularly the sites page,  and separate
# pages are generated for each month, which can consume quite a lot
# of disk space depending on the traffic to your site.
# All404Errors displays a table of error requests, and the corresponding
# referring URL.

# AWFFull normally strips the string 'index.' off the end of
# URL's in order to consolidate URL totals.  For example, the URL
# /somedir/index.html is turned into /somedir/ which is really the
# same URL.  This option allows you to specify additional strings
# to treat in the same way.  You don't need to specify 'index.' as
# it is always scanned for by AWFFull, this option is just to
# specify _additional_ strings if needed.  If you don't need any,
# don't specify any as each string will be scanned for in EVERY
# log record... A bunch of them will degrade performance.  Also,
# the string is scanned for anywhere in the URL, so a string of
# 'home' would turn the URL /somedir/homepages/brad/home.html into
# just /somedir/ which is probably not what was intended.

#IndexAlias     home.htm
#IndexAlias     homepage.htm

# The Hide*, Group* and Ignore* and Include* keywords allow you to
# change the way Sites, URL's, Referrers, User Agents and User names
# are manipulated.  The Ignore* keywords will cause AWFFull to
# completely ignore records as if they didn't exist (and thus not
# counted in the main site totals).  The Hide* keywords will prevent
# things from being displayed in the 'Top' tables, but will still be
# counted in the main totals.  The Group* keywords allow grouping
# similar objects as if they were one.  Grouped records are displayed
# in the 'Top' tables and can optionally be displayed in BOLD and/or
# shaded. Groups cannot be hidden, and are not counted in the main
# totals. The Group* options do not, by default, hide all the items
# that it matches.  If you want to hide the records that match (so just
# the grouping record is displayed), follow with an identical Hide*
# keyword with the same value.  (see example below)  In addition,
# Group* keywords may have an optional label which will be displayed
# instead of the keywords value.  The label should be separated from
# the value by at least one 'white-space' character, such as a space
# or tab.
#
# The value can have either a leading or trailing '*' wildcard
# character.  If no wildcard is found, a match can occur anywhere
# in the string. Given a string "www.yourmama.com", the values "your",
# "*mama.com" and "www.your*" will all match.

# HideAllSites allows forcing individual sites to be hidden in the
# report.  This is particularly useful when used in conjunction
# with the "GroupDomain" feature, but could be useful in other
# situations as well, such as when you only want to display grouped
# sites (with the GroupSite keywords...).  The value for this
# keyword can be either 'yes' or 'no', with 'no' the default,
# allowing individual sites to be displayed.

#HideAllSites   no

# The GroupDomains keyword allows you to group individual host names
# into their respective domains.  The value specifies the level of
# grouping to perform, and can be thought of as 'the number of dots'
# that will be displayed.  For example, if a visiting host is named
# cust1.tnt.mia.uu.net, a domain grouping of 1 will result in just
# "uu.net" being displayed, while a 2 will result in "mia.uu.net".
# The default value of zero disable this feature.  Domains will only
# be grouped if they do not match any existing "GroupSite" records,
# which allows overriding this feature with your own if desired.

#GroupDomains   0

# The GroupShading allows grouped rows to be shaded in the report.
# Useful if you have lots of groups and individual records that
# intermingle in the report, and you want to differentiate the group
# records a little more.  Value can be 'yes' or 'no', with 'yes'
# being the default.

#GroupShading   yes

# GroupHighlight allows the group record to be displayed in BOLD.
# Can be either 'yes' or 'no' with the default 'yes'.

#GroupHighlight yes

# The Ignore* keywords allow you to completely ignore log records based
# on hostname, URL, user agent, referrer or user name.  I hesitated in
# adding these, since the Webalizer was designed to generate _accurate_
# statistics about a web servers performance.  By choosing to ignore
# records, the accuracy of reports become skewed, negating why I wrote
# this program in the first place.  However, due to popular demand, here
# they are.  Use the same as the Hide* keywords, where the value can have
# a leading or trailing wildcard '*'.  Use at your own risk ;)

#IgnoreSite     bad.site.net
#IgnoreURL      /test*
#IgnoreReferrer file:/*
#IgnoreAgent    RealPlayer
#IgnoreUser     root

# The Include* keywords allow you to force the inclusion of log records
# based on hostname, URL, user agent, referrer or user name.  They take
# precedence over the Ignore* keywords.  Note: Using Ignore/Include
# combinations to selectively process parts of a web site is _extremely
# inefficient_!!! Avoid doing so if possible (ie: grep the records to a
# separate file if you really want that kind of report).

# Example: Only show stats on Joe User's pages...
#IgnoreURL      *
#IncludeURL     ~joeuser*

# Or based on an authenticated user name
#IgnoreUser     *
#IncludeUser    someuser

# The MangleAgents allows you to specify how much, if any, AWFFull
# should mangle user agent names.  This allows several levels of detail
# to be produced when reporting user agent statistics.  There are six
# levels that can be specified, which define different levels of detail
# suppression.  Level 5 shows only the browser name (MSIE or Mozilla)
# and the major version number.  Level 4 adds the minor version number
# (single decimal place).  Level 3 displays the minor version to two
# decimal places.  Level 2 will add any sub-level designation (such
# as Mozilla/3.01Gold or MSIE 3.0b).  Level 1 will attempt to also add
# the system type if it is specified.  The default Level 0 displays the
# full user agent field without modification and produces the greatest
# amount of detail.  User agent names that can't be mangled will be
# left unmodified.

#MangleAgents    0

# The SearchEngine keywords allow specification of search engines and
# their query strings on the URL.  These are used to locate and report
# what search strings are used to find your site.  The first word is
# a substring to match in the referrer field that identifies the search
# engine, and the second is the URL variable used by that search engine
# to define it's search terms.

# AssignToCountry allows a form of override to force given domains
# to a specified country. Use the standard 2 letter country codes.
# Can also use org, com, net and so on, if more appropriate.
# With judicious use of the AllSites, GroupSite and 'whois', this
# can fairly easily cover all your majority users with not too much
# effort.

# The Dump* keywords allow the dumping of Sites, URL's, Referrers
# User Agents, User names and Search strings to separate tab delimited
# text files, suitable for import into most database or spreadsheet
# programs.

# DumpPath specifies the path to dump the files.  If not specified,
# it will default to the current output directory.  Do not use a
# trailing slash ('/').

#DumpPath       /var/lib/httpd/logs

# The DumpHeader keyword specifies if a header record should be
# written to the file.  A header record is the first record of the
# file, and contains the labels for each field written.  Normally,
# files that are intended to be imported into a database system
# will not need a header record, while spreadsheets usually do.
# Value can be either 'yes' or 'no', with 'no' being the default.

#DumpHeader     no

# DumpExtension allow you to specify the dump filename extension
# to use.  The default is "tab", but some programs are picky about
# the filenames they use, so you may change it here (for example,
# some people may prefer to use "csv").

# These control the dumping of each individual table.  The value
# can be either 'yes' or 'no'.. the default is 'no'.
